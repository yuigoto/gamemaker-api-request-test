# GameMaker API Request Test

> This is a very small and crude example on how to handle API requests with a JSON endpoint, with GameMaker: Studio 1.

This project aims to be just what I told you above: a **very** simple example, with no extra stuff (like headers and data), and I leave it up to you to figure things out for the rest of the stuff.

The only dependency required is **GameMaker: Studio** version 1, though it might work on version 2 too, without problems.
